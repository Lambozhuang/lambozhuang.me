How can we help hikers pack their stuff? This is a project that I have done in the interaction design course in KTH for the past 2 months with my fellow classmates: Laieh Jwella, Oskar Rebermark and Sabika Amalina. We developed a prototype app which aims to help hikers to connect to each other using Figma.

## Table of contents

## Introduction

The key concept we centered our work around was interdependence -- a term that we took time to carefully define and reflect upon in the context of outdoor activities like hiking.

"Interdependence"

Interdependence is the mutual reliance between entities, where each depends on the other for resources or support. Hiking activities involve interdependent behaviors among hikers, even from the preparation to the end of a hike.

## Design process

We conducted our project with the Double Diamond design process.
