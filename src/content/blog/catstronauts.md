Catstronauts: The Great Earth Escape is a 2D cooperative stealth-adventure game where up to four players take control of stranded space cats trying to rebuild their spaceship and escape Earth. Players must sneak through lively city environments, collect items, solve cooperative puzzles, and avoid captureâ€”all while balancing teamwork, chaos, and humor in a colorful pixel-art world.

As part of a five-person team, I helped develop Catstronauts: The Great Earth Escape, a cooperative 2D multiplayer stealth-adventure built in **Godot**. The game follows four stranded space cats who must sneak through Earthâ€™s cities, collect treasures for a gangster cat, and secretly recover spaceship parts to return home. With its colorful pixel-art style, teamwork-driven puzzles, and chaotic stealth mechanics, the game blends humor with light-hearted challenge.

My primary responsibility was game programming, focusing especially on **multiplayer network implementation**. I designed and integrated the serverâ€“client networking model using Godotâ€™s high-level APIs, ensuring synchronized player movement, NPC behaviors, item interactions, and game state across four players. I also worked on gameplay systems such as player controls, item handling, and interaction mechanics that form the backbone of the cooperative experience.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with multiplayer game architecture, synchronization, and RPC-based communication in Godot, while collaborating closely with teammates handling art, level design, and narrative. The result is a fully playable demo of our first level, showcasing the foundations of a larger, story-driven cooperative adventure.
